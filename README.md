# JWT Serverless Authentication

This is a demo about how you can authenticate your endpoints using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with API Gateway.

These are the deployed endpoints:
- `/create-account` (public) Fill in a name and create an account
- `/get-token` (public) Get the token needed for the account you entered
- `/read-account` (authenticated) Get the account data
- `/update-account` (authenticated) Update the account data 

<br />

For all the authenticated endpoints we have to include a valid token in the request.
>NOTE: They expire after 5m, so it should be a recent one

The token is generated by `get-token`, there we sign it with a secret stored in the backend. The requests that require authentication (`/read-account` and `/update-account`) will fail if the token isn't signed with that same secret (or has expired).

Check what you get when reading or updating the account data while checking/unchecking "Include token in Authorization Header" option.
